# AsTheCrow
This short web design project was implimented with the Trimble Maps API, along with an API key. 

Description:
The purpose of this project is to determine the distance between two points on a map, "As the crow flies". The projet uses longitude and latitude to determine this.
It also takes into account the curvature of the Earth, which explains why Google may tell you the distance between two given points as the row flies is shorter than 
what this project displays.

Operation:
The project will display a map from the Trimble Maps API and two pins. 
The pins may be dragged to any point on the map, or be placed by left clicking the map to place the A pin and right clicking the map to place the B pin.
In the upper left corner of the screen, the longitude and latitude of each pin is displayed, as well as the calculated distane between the two.
